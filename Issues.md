OSH JS Issues
---

1. web worker imports
    - instead of importing DataSourceWorker.worker.js, the import should happen as the worker is created
   ```
      console.log('Worker props ARGS', properties);

        let workerUrl;
        try {
            workerUrl = new URL('./worker/DataSource.worker.js', import.meta.url);
            console.log('Worker URL:', workerUrl);
        } catch (e) {
            console.error('Failed to create worker URL:', e);
        }

        const worker = new Worker(workerUrl, { type: 'module' });
        const extWorker = new WorkerExt(worker);
        console.log('Worker created:', extWorker);
        return extWorker;
      ```
    - Same for FFMPEG
   ```
    // this.decodeWorker = new DecodeWorker();
        let decodeWorkerUrl = new URL('./workers/ffmpeg.decode.video.worker.js', import.meta.url);

        this.decodeWorker = new Worker(decodeWorkerUrl, {type: 'module'});
   ```
   
2. import statements
   - there is an issue where an `assert` named function is imported, but it does not exist. This many not be the case in
3.0.0
3. Cesium import
    - `  createDefaultImageryProviderViewModels,` doesn't exist in certain versions of Cesium and appears unused.
4. LeafletView unused 'assert' import
